If the other end has closed the connection, we may have a "Broken pipe" error.
We should recover from that, close the out-of-order socket and open a new one.

As of version 0.03, it is impossible to start two xot daemons at the same time
if they have the different listening port number. 
So it is impossible for now to connect a Linux box to more than one XOT gateway.

The next one is not a xotd bug, rather a RFC1613 limitation.
xotd doesn't work in loopback ("xotd x25tap0 localhost") because X.25 requires 
separate devices for opening circuits. The work around is to change XOT TCP 
ports.
